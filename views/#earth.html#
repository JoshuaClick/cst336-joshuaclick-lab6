<p>Earth is the third planet around the Sun, orbiting out at roughly 150 million kilometers, or one astronomical unit. It rotates around its poles 356.256 times per orbit--this defines our day and year, respectively.</p>
<p>Earth is, as far as we know, the only place that life exists in the Universe.</p>
